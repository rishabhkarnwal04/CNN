# CNN on CIFAR-10 

This project implements a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch/Keras for the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes:

- Multiple convolutional layers
- Pooling and dropout for regularization
- Backpropagation and training loop
- Visualization of learned filters (feature maps)
- Confusion matrix and test set evaluation
- GPU compatibility (PyTorch/Keras)

---

## Features

- Trains a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Visualizes learned filters during training.
- Displays test predictions with animation.
- Includes test accuracy and confusion matrix plot.
- Easy to run in **Google Colab** or **locally with GPU**.
